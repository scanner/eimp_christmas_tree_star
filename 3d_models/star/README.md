You will need to print 11 of the 'star_point.stl's and one of the
'star_point_bottom.stl'.

You will need to print a bunch of 'star_point_grippers.stl' which are
used to hook the star points together.

You will need at least a table mount ('star_table_mount.stl'), and if
you wish to mount the star on top of a tree then 'star_tree_mount.stl'
as well.
